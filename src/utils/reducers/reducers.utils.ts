 *  -> type: is the ts type from one of the createAction overloads, the syntax ['type'] can be used to extract this value because the type we are creating is an object :)  
 *  -> match(): recieves an action which will be of the type AnyAction (AnyAction being a redux action object)
 *    -> So whatever redux action match() gets given, if it passes the check then we know that the redux action given to match() is the return type of the generic AC
 * 
 * Furthermore the AC generic we are passing in for example could be 'FetchCategoriesStart' (category.action.ts) this is an alias for the generic the createAction overloads.
 *  -> see the createAction overloads for the properties they have on them. eg - type: T

 * We don't need to use the ts <> syntax here as we are explicitly typing the actionCreator param to be a Function 
 *  -> in the case we were not 100% on the type being passed in then we would use the <> generic syntax
 * 
 * We can access the .type of the actionCreator() due to it returning a redux action with a type property and a payload property -> which can be seen below
 *  -> we could also get .payload too if we wanted to
 * 
 * Then we assign two new methods:
 *  -> .type is the action type from the redux action object.... ðŸ¤”
